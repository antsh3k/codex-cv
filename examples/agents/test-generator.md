# Test Generation Instructions

Generate comprehensive test suites that ensure code reliability and maintainability.

## Test Types to Generate

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Cover edge cases, boundary conditions, and error scenarios
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Ensure high code coverage for critical paths

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions and data flow
- Verify external service integrations
- Test configuration and environment setup
- Validate end-to-end workflows

### Property-Based Tests
- Generate tests that verify code properties across many inputs
- Use fuzzing techniques for robustness testing
- Test invariants and contracts

## Testing Best Practices

- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests clearly with setup, execution, and verification
- **Descriptive Names**: Use test names that clearly describe what is being tested
- **Isolation**: Ensure tests don't depend on each other or external state
- **Deterministic**: Tests should produce consistent results across runs
- **Fast Execution**: Optimize for quick feedback loops

## Framework Selection

Choose appropriate testing frameworks based on the project language:
- **Rust**: Use `cargo test`, `proptest` for property-based testing
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use Jest, Vitest, or similar frameworks
- **Python**: Use pytest or unittest
- **Go**: Use built-in testing package with testify

## Output Structure

Generate tests with:

1. **Setup/Teardown**: Proper test environment preparation
2. **Test Cases**: Comprehensive coverage of functionality
3. **Assertions**: Clear, specific verification of expected behavior
4. **Documentation**: Comments explaining complex test scenarios
5. **Utilities**: Helper functions for common test patterns

Focus on creating maintainable tests that provide confidence in code correctness and make refactoring safer.

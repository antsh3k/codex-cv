# Bug Hunting Instructions

Systematically analyze code to identify, diagnose, and propose fixes for bugs and potential issues.

## Analysis Strategy

### Static Analysis
- **Type mismatches**: Check for incorrect type usage and conversions
- **Null/undefined handling**: Identify missing null checks and potential NPEs
- **Resource management**: Look for memory leaks, unclosed files, or connections
- **Concurrency issues**: Check for race conditions, deadlocks, or thread safety

### Logic Analysis
- **Boundary conditions**: Test edge cases and limits
- **Control flow**: Verify conditional logic and loop termination
- **Error handling**: Ensure proper exception handling and error propagation
- **State management**: Check for inconsistent state transitions

### Common Bug Patterns
- **Off-by-one errors**: Array bounds and loop conditions
- **Integer overflow/underflow**: Numeric computation limits
- **String manipulation**: Encoding issues, buffer overflows
- **API misuse**: Incorrect parameter passing or return value handling

## Diagnostic Process

1. **Reproduce the Issue**: Understand the specific symptoms and conditions
2. **Isolate the Problem**: Narrow down to the minimal failing case
3. **Trace Execution**: Follow the code path that leads to the bug
4. **Identify Root Cause**: Determine the fundamental issue, not just symptoms
5. **Propose Fix**: Suggest targeted, minimal changes that address the root cause

## Bug Report Format

```
## Bug Analysis

### Issue Description
[Clear description of the problem]

### Location
File: [path]
Lines: [line numbers]

### Root Cause
[Explanation of why the bug occurs]

### Proposed Fix
[Specific code changes needed]

### Test Case
[Example that reproduces the issue and validates the fix]

### Impact Assessment
[Severity and potential side effects]
```

Focus on providing actionable solutions that not only fix the immediate issue but also prevent similar bugs in the future.

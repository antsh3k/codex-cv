# Code Review Instructions

Walk through each staged diff and report:

## Analysis Areas

- **Logic bugs or missing edge cases**: Look for potential runtime errors, incorrect conditionals, missing null checks, or edge cases that could cause unexpected behavior.

- **Formatting violations not covered by automated tools**: Check for inconsistent naming conventions, unclear variable names, or style patterns that don't follow project conventions.

- **Security or privacy concerns**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection risks, XSS vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, or improper input validation.

- **Performance considerations**: Flag obvious performance issues like unnecessary loops, inefficient algorithms, or resource leaks.

- **Maintainability issues**: Point out overly complex code, missing documentation for complex logic, or patterns that would be difficult for other developers to understand.

## Output Format

Please provide findings in this structure:

```
## Review Summary
